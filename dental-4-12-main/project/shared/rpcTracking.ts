// ─── RPC (two-visit preventive care) roll-up, shared by server and client ──
//
// Sprint 140. This join used to run in the BROWSER, so the RPC Tracking page
// pulled SIX whole collections — students, schools, IPTRs, preventive-care
// records, dental charts and tooth records — to draw one list.
//
// MOVED, not copied. The 4-6 month window, the school-year cutoff and the
// tooth-count roll-ups decide what a DOH return reports; a second copy would
// drift, and the drift would be invisible until two screens disagreed.
//
// Nothing here may import mongoose or React.
