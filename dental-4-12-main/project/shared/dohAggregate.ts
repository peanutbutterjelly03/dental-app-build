// Sprint 138. This logic used to live in `useDohReportData` and run in the
// BROWSER, which is why the browser had to download eleven whole collections
// to draw one report: measured 2026-09-05 at ~108 KB for 26 pupils, i.e.
// ~4.1 KB per pupil per page open — about 32 MB at the Chapter 1 scale of
// 8,000 pupils, and 60-80 MB once mouths are charted at a realistic 20-32
// teeth rather than the demo's ~5.
//
// It is MOVED here, not copied. Two implementations of a DOH return would
// drift, and the drift would show up as two different numbers on a document
// filed with the City Health Office.
//
// `shared/` is the project's cross-boundary module (Sprint 120/121, already in
// both tsconfigs). Nothing here may import mongoose or React: the server calls
// it with lean documents, and the types below are the intersection both sides
// agree on.
