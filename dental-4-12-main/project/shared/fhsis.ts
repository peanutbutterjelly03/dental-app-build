// ─── FHSIS monthly counts, shared by the server and the client ────────────
//
// Sprint 142. This tally used to run in the BROWSER, so the FHSIS report
// pulled FOUR whole collections — students, IPTRs, preventive-care records and
// schools — to draw one month of counts.
//
// The OUTPUT IS COUNTS, so the response is flat: it does not grow with the
// roll. MOVED, not copied — the "within a year" qualifier on a completed 2nd
// visit, and the rule that an unrecorded `facility_based` lands in
// `unrecorded` rather than being guessed into a or b, are what make this
// return honest.
//
// Nothing here may import mongoose or React.
