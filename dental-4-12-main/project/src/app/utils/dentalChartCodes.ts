// The dental chart's VOCABULARY and ARITHMETIC — the FDI tooth layout, the
// condition and treatment codes, their colours, and the DMF/dmf count.
//
// Extracted from `components/DentalChart.tsx` in Sprint 162, unchanged. Two
// reasons, and the second is the one that matters:
//
//  1. Dashboard, Reports, RPCTracking and IptrForm all imported `treatmentCodes`
//     / `treatmentLabel` from a 3,088-line COMPONENT, so opening any of those
//     screens pulled the whole chart module in behind them.
//  2. None of this is React, and keeping it inside a component is what kept
//     `computeDMFT` untestable — Sprint 158 wanted it and had to record it as
//     "module-local inside DentalChart.tsx, extracting it is Sprint 162's job".
//
// ⚠ NOTHING HERE CHANGED IN THE MOVE. Comments are carried verbatim because
// several of them record decisions that cost a sprint to make.

 * **The latest charting that actually HAS tooth records** — not simply the

 * caller must render that as "not recorded", never as 0.
 *
 * ⚠ THE DISTINCTION IS THE WHOLE POINT. `0` means examined and no decay found;
 * `null` means nothing was charted. A charting whose teeth are all sound has
 * records, so it correctly yields 0 rather than null.
 *
 * Not "sum every charting": the user's 2026-09-05 decision is that each
 * charting is one visit's findings, read alone and never merged.
