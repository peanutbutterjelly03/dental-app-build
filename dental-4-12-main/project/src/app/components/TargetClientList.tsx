// ─── Target Client List for Oral Health Care and Services ────────────────────
// Transcribed from the manuscript's APPENDIX E (not D — Appendix D is the DMFX
// Index Score). The appendix is a low-resolution scan of the paper DOH form, so
// the column set below was read off it directly; three labels were illegible
// and are marked in the header definitions.
//
// HONESTY NOTE — several columns are rendered but CANNOT be filled from the
// current data model, and are deliberately left blank rather than faked:
// PREVENTIVE_CARE_RECORD stores per-visit DATE, NUMBER and (since Sprint 81)
// facility_based, but no per-visit SERVICE. That means the FIRST/SECOND
// service columns (oral hygiene instruction, counselling, oral prophylaxis,
// fluoride varnish, complete RPC) still have no source. The visit DATES are
// real, and so are the curative treatment codes.
//
// Sprint 82 added the columns the real form has and this table did not, using
// the missing-column list Sprint 80 read off the DOH workbook
// (TCLForm2andFHSISReport.xlsx). Which of them carry REAL data:
//   * Facility Based (column C) — real, from Sprint 81's facility_based.
//   * Pit and Fissure Sealant / Temporary Filling (Tooth Count) — real TOOTH
//     COUNTS from TOOTH_RECORD, not just "ever had it".
//   * Orally Fit Child, Upon Oral Examination — real, the same oralStatus the
//     dashboard and the Program Report's OFC row read.
//   * Last / Next Dental Visit — real, from APPOINTMENT (split on now).
// Blank because nothing records them: Family Serial Number, Barangay (STUDENT
// has no such fields — address is one free-text line), Complete Mouth Rehab,
// Orally Fit After Complete Mouth Rehabilitation.
//
// ⚠ Two column-set corrections, both from the workbook, NOT invented here:
//   * `Gum Treatment` was ONE guessed column; the form has TWO (Scaling,
//     Prescription). Split, which removes an `unverified` flag rather than
//     adding one.
//   * `Complete Health Record` was REMOVED — Sprint 80 established it does not
//     exist on the real form at all. This is the one deletion; every other
//     column stays even when empty, per CLAUDE.md.
//
// ⚠ NOT VERIFIABLE ON THIS MACHINE: the workbook lives in per-device `data/`
// and was supplied to the other laptop, so the "66 columns" total could not be
// re-counted here. The additions follow HANDOFF's written list from the
// session that DID read the file. Re-check the count against the workbook
// before treating this table as complete.

 *  the two SECOND columns that had data, which made the sheet stop matching the
 *  form. All of them are rendered now, blank where there is no source.
 *
 *  `value` reads a row; a column WITHOUT one has no source in the data model
 *  (PREVENTIVE_CARE_RECORD stores only iptr_id, visit_date and visit_number, so
 *  no per-visit service is recorded anywhere) and renders "—".
 *
 *  ⚠ `unverified` NOW FLAGS NOTHING — every caption in this list is verified
 *  (Sprint 103). The mechanism is kept because the next form transcribed from a
 *  scan will need it, and both the dotted underline and the note above the table
 *  self-hide at zero. Do NOT re-add a flag without saying which source settled
 *  it. History: most were resolved on
 *  2026-09-02 against the machine-readable DOH workbook the user supplied
 *  (TCLForm2andFHSISReport.xlsx, sheet "6-9 Y.O (M)" row 4) -- the authoritative
 *  source that replaced the low-resolution Appendix E scan. Corrections made:
 *  "Completed BPOC" -> "Complete RPC for 1st Visit Routine Preventative Care"
 *  (the app had invented an acronym), "Referral" -> "Referred Out", and the 2nd
 *  SDF application is a TOOTH COUNT, not a yes/no.
 *
 *  THREE REMAIN FLAGGED, deliberately -- the workbook does not settle them:
 *   - "Gum Treatment": the real form carries TWO columns, `Gum Treatment -
 *     Scaling` (BE) and `Gum Treatment - Prescription` (BF). Which one this
 *     single column means is a guess, so splitting it belongs with the missing-
 *     columns work, not here.
 *   - "Removal of Plaque / Calculus": the form's nearest column is `Oral
 *     Prophylaxis`, which this table already has separately.
 *   - "Complete Health Record": no such column exists on the real form at all.
 *
 *  Original note follows.
 *  ⚠ `unverified` marks a caption read off the low-resolution Appendix E scan
 *  that could not be made out with confidence. Shown with a dotted underline
 *  and counted in the note above the table. CHECK AGAINST THE PAPER FORM.
 *
 *  ⚠ STILL UNCHECKED, and NOT checkable on this machine: the 1st-visit caption
 *  says "Routine Preventative Care" while the 2nd says "Routine Preventive
 *  Care". One of those spellings is likely wrong, but settling it needs
 *  TCLForm2andFHSISReport.xlsx, which lives in the gitignored per-device
 *  `data/` folder and is on the OTHER laptop. Left exactly as transcribed

          The form IS two pages — Sprint 134 established the split and the Excel
          export has produced two sheets ever since, but the screen still ran all
          66 columns into a single 2,850px table. That put the columns in an
          order the form does not have: ORALLY FIT CHILD closes page 1 on paper
          and was rendering after OTHER SERVICES here, so anyone reading the
          screen was reading a different document from the one they file.

          Same split as the workbook export below, from one constant, so the two
          can never disagree: PAGE1_GROUPS ends page 1 at ORAL HEALTH STATUS +
          ORALLY FIT CHILD; everything else is page 2, which repeats `No.` as
          the form's own row link between the pages.

          Each page scrolls inside its own container — the form is wider than any
          screen and the page itself must never scroll sideways. */}
