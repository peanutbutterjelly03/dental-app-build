    // ERD deviation, like REFERRAL and DAY_NOTE. Until now this model recorded
    // that a pupil was SEEN and never what was DONE — four fields, none of them
    // a service — while CLAUDE.md's module 5 defines an RPC visit as exactly
    // these services and page 2 of the Target Client List prints them as
    // per-visit tick columns for the 1st and 2nd visit.

    // ⚠ THIS IS WHAT MADE THREE FILED FIGURES APPROXIMATIONS. With no service
    // on the visit, the TCL had to answer "has this pupil EVER had fluoride
    // varnish?" from the dental chart where the form asks "was it done at THIS
    // visit?", and the DOH report inferred 1st/2nd application from chart dates
    // because nothing recorded the ordinal. Both said so in their own comments.
    //
    // ⚠ DEFAULT null, NOT false — the same rule `facility_based` above follows,
    // and for the same reason. Every visit recorded before this change has no
    // answer, and `false` would claim on a form filed with the City Health
    // Office that a service was withheld. Null reads as "not recorded".
